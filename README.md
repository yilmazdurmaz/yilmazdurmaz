# Welcome

Hey there,

I have just figured out how to set this index page. So please be patient. It will take some time to fill it in with what you would expect from an index page.

-------------
The remaning part of this page is the default content of theme file I selected. I will keep them for a while until I figure out how to shape this index page.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/yilmazdurmaz/yilmazdurmaz/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yilmazdurmaz/yilmazdurmaz/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
